# House_price_prediction
House price prediction using machine learning involves building a model that can predict the selling price of a house based on various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other features. The model is trained on historical data that includes the features of previously sold houses and their corresponding selling prices.

The first step in building a house price prediction model is to collect and preprocess the data. This involves gathering data on house sales and extracting the relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, the location, and the size of the house. The data is then cleaned and preprocessed by removing any missing or irrelevant information.

The next step is to split the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. Various machine learning algorithms can be used to train the model, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests.
